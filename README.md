# vim-cheat

Prints vim commands to terminal ... so you can `grep` them.

## To-Do

- [ ] use yaml - like [rtorr/vim-cheat-sheet/_config.yml](https://github.com/rtorr/vim-cheat-sheet/blob/master/_config.yml) - to provide searching

## Stolen from
The commands are taken directly from [rtorr/vim-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/rtorr/vim-cheat-sheet) ([website](http://vim.rtorr.com/)), I just wanted them on my terminal.
